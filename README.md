This is a repository that contains basic introduction for domain decomposition method and example matlab code. There is an introductory pdf file but incomplete for iterative solver parts (will be updated). Anyone can use this to solve specific problem that you want but results cannot be guaranteed. Any comments are always welcome. 

Usage of matlab code in Matlab_code directory:

Simply type FEM_CG in Matlab command window
